# ðŸš½ Pipex
![hmechich's 42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/hmechich/pipex)  
Summary: This project is the discovery in detail and by programming of a UNIX mechanism that you already know.  
  
Version: 2

## Common Instructions
- Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm. If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check and you will receive a 0 if there is a norm error inside.
- Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non functional and will receive a 0 during the evaluation.
- All heap allocated memory space must be properly freed when necessary. No leaks will be tolerated.
- If the subject requires it, you must submit a Makefile which will compile your source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.
- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and re.
- To turn in bonuses to your project, you must include a rule bonus to your Makefile, which will add all the various headers, librairies or functions that are forbidden on the main part of the project. Bonuses must be in a different file \_bonus.{c/h}. Mandatory and bonus part evaluation is done separately
- If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your projectâ€™s Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.
- We encourage you to create test programs for your project even though this work wonâ€™t have to be submitted and wonâ€™t be graded. It will give you a chance to easily test your work and your peersâ€™ work. You will find those tests especially useful during your defence. Indeed, during defence, you are free to use your tests and/or the tests of the peer you are evaluating
- Submit your work to your assigned git repository. Only the work in the git repository will be graded. If Deepthought is assigned to grade your work, it will be done after your peer-evaluations. If an error happens in any section of your work during Deepthoughtâ€™s grading, the evaluation will stop.
  
## Mandatory part
- The executable file must be named pipex.
- You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your sources files. It must not relink.
- You have to handle errors sensitively. In no way can your program quit unexpectedly (Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc). If you are unsure, handle the errors like the shell command < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2.
- Your program cannot have memory leaks.
- You are allowed to use the following functions:
	- access
	- open
	- unlink
	- close
	- read
	- write
	- malloc
	- waitpid
	- wait
	- free
	- pipe
	- dup
	- dup2
	- execve
	- fork
	- perror
	- strerror
	- exit
  
## Objectives
Your objective is to code the Pipex program.  
It should be executed in this way:
`$> ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2`  
Just in case: file1 and file2 are file names, cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters.  
  
The execution of the pipex program should do the same as the next shell command:  
`$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2`  

### Examples
`$> ./pipex infile "ls -l" "wc -l" outfile` == `$> < infile ls -l | wc -l outfile`  
`$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile` == `$> < infile grep a1 | wc -w outfile`
